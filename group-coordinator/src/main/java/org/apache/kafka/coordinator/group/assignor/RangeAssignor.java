/**
 * <p>The Server Side Sticky Range Assignor inherits properties of both the range assignor and the sticky assignor.
 * Properties are :-
 * <ul>
 * <li> 1) Each consumer must get at least one partition per topic that it is subscribed to whenever the number of consumers is
 *    less than or equal to the number of partitions for that topic. (Range) </li>
 * <li> 2) Partitions should be assigned to consumers in a way that facilitates join operations where required. (Range) </li>
 *    This can only be done if the topics are co-partitioned in the first place
 *    Co-partitioned:-
 *    Two streams are co-partitioned if the following conditions are met:-
 * ->The keys must have the same schemas
 * ->The topics involved must have the same number of partitions
 * <li> 3) Consumers should retain as much as their previous assignment as possible. (Sticky) </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The algorithm works mainly in 5 steps described below
 * <ul>
 * <li> 1) Get a map of the consumersPerTopic created using the member subscriptions.</li>
 * <li> 2) Get a list of consumers (potentiallyUnfilled) that have not met the minimum required quota for assignment AND
 * get a list of sticky partitions that we want to retain in the new assignment.</li>
 * <li> 3) Add consumers from potentiallyUnfilled to Unfilled if they haven't met the total required quota = minQuota + (if necessary) extraPartition </li>
 * <li> 4) Get a list of available partitions by calculating the difference between total partitions and assigned sticky partitions </li>
 * <li> 5) Iterate through unfilled consumers and assign partitions from available partitions </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
