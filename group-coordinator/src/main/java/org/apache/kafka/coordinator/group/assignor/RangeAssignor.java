/**
 * <p>The Server Side Sticky Range Assignor inherits properties of both the range assignor and the sticky assignor.
 * Properties are as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Each member must get at least one partition for every topic that it is subscribed to. The only exception is when
 *      the number of subscribed members is greater than the number of partitions for that topic. (Range) </li>
 * <li> Partitions should be assigned to members in a way that facilitates the join operation when required. (Range) </li>
 *    This can only be done if every member is subscribed to the same topics and the topics are co-partitioned.
 *    Two streams are co-partitioned if the following conditions are met:
 *    <ul>
 * <li> The keys must have the same schemas.
 * <li> The topics involved must have the same number of partitions.
 *    </ul>
 * <li> Members should retain as much as their previous assignment as possible to reduce the number of partition movements during reassignment. (Sticky) </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The algorithm includes the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Generate a map of <code>membersPerTopic</code> using the given member subscriptions.</li>
 * <li> Generate a list of members (<code>potentiallyUnfilledMembers</code>) that have not met the minimum required quota for assignment AND
 * get a list of sticky partitions that we want to retain in the new assignment.</li>
 * <li> Add members from the <code>potentiallyUnfilled</code> list to the <code>Unfilled</code> list if they haven't met the total required quota i.e. minimum number of partitions per member + 1 (if member is designated to receive one of the excess partitions) </li>
 * <li> Generate a list of unassigned partitions by calculating the difference between total partitions and already assigned (sticky) partitions </li>
 * <li> Iterate through unfilled members and assign partitions from the unassigned partitions </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
